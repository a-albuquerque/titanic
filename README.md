# Titanic Dataset - Building and assessing a supervised Machine Learning model

Here I am using Kaggle's Titanic dataset for personal education. I intend to hands-on learn how to build a simple machine learning model through popular frameworks on Python. The goal is to train the model and then predict survival of passangers not included in the training file (supervised/labelled ML). The project is small and for personal training only, please expect low standards on aesthetics or directory structure.

## Objective
We want build a model and to know how accurate it is in predicting survival if it know the passenger age, sex, class and family size.


## Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset is a csv file with passagers' information about on their ticket class, sex, age, size of family, fare, cabin number and port of entrance to the ship. It also contains whether they survived.
