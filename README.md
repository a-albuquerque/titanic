# Titanic Dataset - Machine Learning Practice

## Overview
Here I am using Kaggle's Titanic dataset for personal education. I intend to learn hands-on machine learning frameworks with Python for training and predicting (supervised labelled ML). 

Dataset details at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data

## Objectives
- Understand supervised learning fundamentals
- Practice data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Compare different classification algorithms
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

## Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset contains passenger information including demographics, ticket class, and survival outcomes. The goal is to predict passenger survival based on features like age, sex, class, and family size.

## Project Structure
- `data/` - Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling
- `src/` - Python scripts for data processing and modeling
- `models/` - Saved trained models
- `results/` - Performance metrics and visualizations

## Technologies & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy - Data manipulation
- scikit-learn - Machine learning algorithms
- matplotlib, seaborn - Visualization
- jupyter - Interactive development

## Approach
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
5. Model evaluation and comparison
6. Hyperparameter tuning

## Results
[To be updated with model performance metrics]

## Key Learnings
[To be documented as the project progresses]
